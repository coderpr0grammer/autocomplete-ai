## Notes
I built this in like 30 minutes, so please be aware that there may be many bugs and issues.

## Overview
The **Sentence Completion Suggester** is a Chrome extension designed to enhance your browsing experience by providing intelligent sentence completions for form fields on web pages. By pressing the Tab key, users can autofill inputs based on context-aware suggestions generated by Azure OpenAI.

## Features
- Autofills input fields by pressing the Tab key.
- Context-aware suggestions based on nearby text and user-defined knowledge base.
- Customizable settings for user-specific information.
- Dynamic addition of custom fields to the knowledge base.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Chrome Browser
- Azure OpenAI account for accessing the completion API.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentence-completion-suggester.git
   ```
3. Navigate to the directory:
   ```
   cd sentence-completion-suggester
   ```
5. Update the environment variables in your code:
   - **AI_COMPLETIONS_ENDPOINT**: Set your Azure OpenAI API endpoint.
   - **AI_COMPLETIONS_API_KEY**: Your API key for accessing Azure OpenAI.

6. Load the extension in Chrome:
   - Go to `chrome://extensions/`.
   - Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in the top right).
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension directory.

### Configuration
You can configure the extension options via the **options page**. Enter general information and add specific fields relevant to your needs.

## Files
- **manifest.json**: Configuration file that defines the extension, including permissions and scripts.
- **options.html**: HTML file for the options page where users can input their knowledge base.
- **options.js**: JavaScript file handling the logic for saving user preferences and dynamically adding knowledge base fields.
- **content.js**: Main script that interacts with web pages to provide autofill functionality based on user input and AI suggestions.

## Usage
1. Navigate to any web page with input fields.
2. Click on an input field to focus on it. The extension will suggest completions based on your knowledge base and context.
3. Press the **Tab** key to autofill the input with the suggested text.

## How It Works
The extension utilizes the Azure OpenAI API to generate contextual suggestions based on:
- The title of the page.
- Headings present on the page.
- Metadata description.
- User-defined fields from the knowledge base.

### Key Functions
- **getVisibleText(element)**: Retrieves visible text from a given HTML element.
- **removeStopWords(str)**: Cleans a string by removing common stop words.
- **getSuggestions(text)**: Calls the OpenAI API to get suggestions based on the input context.
